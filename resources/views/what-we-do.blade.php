                <p>We keep your pets safe. We use DogSafe Underground Fences to provide a secure, reliable, adaptable, boundary for your pets. Our DogSafe Fence creates an invisible boundary to keep your pets in your yard and away from places you donâ€™t want them, such as gardens, driveways, barns, and swimming pools.</p>
                <p>At DogSafe we use top of the line technology and stand by it with our Lifetime Warranty and 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. So no one has to hesitate about the quality of our product. Our collar receivers that we use are waterproof, programmable for any size dog, and expandable for large yards over 10 acres.</p>
                <p>Our number one concern is the safety and well-being of your pet. Installation normally takes a few hours and the training is uniquely humane to provide the best experience for you and your pet. We provide the support you need to ensure successful training and happy containment. We are experienced professionals committed to providing excellent customer service and support. We strive to service every customer promptly and courteously.</p>
